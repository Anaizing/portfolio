gatsby component architecture in the current version 2.4.2

- graphql passes `data` via a staticquery component

- the staticquery component renders the react component via its render property, where it passes a data and any props required

- the static graphql queries passed to every component via each staticquery are referenced in the gatsby-config.js file (very fucking important), add required references there as you grow the components
