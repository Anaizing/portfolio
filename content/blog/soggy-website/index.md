### SOGGY INK GAMES PTY LTD website

Welcome to my brainchild—a responsive, single-page web app that's more than a website; it's a code symphony! This creation blends a captivating blog, a stellar landing page, a seamless registration form, and UI/UX so smooth, it makes butter jealous.

As the architect of this digital wonderland, I didn't just assemble technologies; I crafted experiences using:
<b></b>

- <b>JavaScript</b>: Where logic meets creativity, problem-solving becomes an art.
- <b>React</b>: Crafting UI components with precision, prioritizing and juggling tasks seamlessly.
- <b>GraphQL</b>: Building a data fortress, learning, adapting, and shaping the structure.
- <b>Emotion</b>: Injecting life into pixels (css in js), obsessing over every design detail
- <b>Gatsby</b>: with this static site generator I engineered a lightning-fast performance and fluid transitions, reflecting code quality and best practices.
- <b>Surge</b>: Launching into digital skies—communicating with servers and hosting, like a charm!
- <b>Photoshop</b>: Armed with this tool, I meticulously crafted and polished visuals, showcasing domain knowledge and innovation.
