### BLENDER ELECTRICITY ASSET

This asset features an animated electricity effect created within Blender, utilizing Geometry Nodes to generate purple lightning that emits sparks upon proximity to nearby objects.

Key steps involved:

> 1. added objects for the electricity to branch, to and from nearby objects
> 2. distributed points from the target object and instanced lines
> 3. found closest objects with the geometry proximity node
> 4. spread out points by mixing some noise into the proximity node
> 5. used that same node to tell how close together the objects are
> 6. took connected arcs and floating arcs and added some distortion
> 7. add a flickering node to to introduce a dynamic, chaotic feel
> 8. gave arcs some thickness and a material for realism
> 9. animated the asset against various HDRI environment backgrounds for diverse visual contexts.

This project serves as a showcase of the electricity effect interacting dynamically with different objects, demonstrated by manipulating the Suzanne head within the scene. The entire scene and the electricity animation were meticulously crafted and animated using Blender's powerful capabilities in geometry nodes and animation.
