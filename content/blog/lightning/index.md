### BLENDER ELECTRIITY ASSET

This is a electricity asset I buit and animated on Blender using Geometry Nodes that shoots off sparks in proximity to other objects.

> 1. added objects for the electricity to branch, to and from nearby objects
> 2. distributed points from the target object and instanced lines
> 3. found closest objects with the geometry proximity node
> 4. spread out points by mixing some noise into the proximity node
> 5. used that same node to tell how close together the objects are
> 6. took connected arcs and floating arcs and added some distortion
> 7. add a flickering mode to make it more chaotic
> 8. gave arcs some thickness and a material
> 9. animated with various HDRI environment backgrounds

I built this scene to demonstrate the electricity clinging to various objects as I move the suzanne head around, I built this scene and animated the elecricity asset using blender blender.
