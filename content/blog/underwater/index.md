It features an flooded bedroom in an underwater world, with a portal and ghost furniture outline built
using VFX Graph, the flooded area of water built with Shader Graph, building/walls created from a floorplan
using Probuilder.
Animation built with cinemachine.

> A fun bit about the interior rock walls, these are actually my neighbour's very real external walls. I
> was able to create a shader from a photograph of their walls and import it to unity to use anywhere I like!
