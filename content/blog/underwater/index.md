### Underwater bedroom level design

This is an underwater styled level design built in Unity for soggyinkgames.
This design demonstrates the use of a variety of unity tools, packages and techniques including...

- ProBuilder
- Shader Graph
- VFX Graph
- post processing

It features an flooded bedroom in an underwater world, with a portal and ghost furniture outline built
using VFX Graph, the flooded area of water built with Shader Graph, building/walls created from a floorplan
using Probuilder.

> A fun bit about the interior rock walls, these are actually my neighbour's very real external walls. I
> was able to create a shader from a photograph of their walls and import it to unity to use anywhere I like!
