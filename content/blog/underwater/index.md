### Underwater bedroom level design

This VR underwater level, developed for SoggyInkGames, serves as my platform to demonstrate my diverse expertise showcasing Unity's adaptable toolkit.

- Leveraging <b>Unity's Engine</b> as the core framework

- <b>ProBuilder</b> for intricate structural modeling

- <b>Shader Graph</b> for crafting mesmerizing underwater visual effects

- Used <b>Visual Effects Graph</b> to make a cool portal and ghostly furniture outlines.

- Implementation of <b>post-processing</b> techniques for heightened visual fidelity

- Orchestrated seamless animated sequences using <b>Cinemachine</b>

- The entire codebase crafted and optimized in <b>C#</b> for seamless integration

Immersing players in an aquatic dreamscape, this scene encapsulates a submerged bedroom, complete with a compelling portal and spectral furniture outlines crafted via Visual Effects Graph. The aqueous surroundings, skillfully rendered using Shader Graph, exhibit a flooded atmosphere, wall construction built from a floor plan design using ProBuilder.

> In a playful dive into creativity, our underwater escapade unveils an amusing twist—an unlikely star makes a cameo: my neighbor's sturdy exterior walls!

By cleverly transforming their property snapshot into an interior rock walls shader, I submerged their essence into this underwater realm. No neighbors got soaked in this virtual flood—promise! This quirky inclusion adds an authentic touch, merging real-life inspirations into this digital sea. It's the creativity that makes ripples—both in water and imagination—highlighting my diverse expertise using Unity's toolkit in crafting unexpectedly neighborly experiences.
